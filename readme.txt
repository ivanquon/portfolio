--Readme document for *Ivan Quon*, *iquon@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
- Appropriate headings and paragraph text
- Semantic HTML tags like aside or footer
    header, section, etc. tags


(b) CSS features
- Leveraging Bootstrap CSS helpers such as image shapes and table layouts to display content in a more interesting manner
- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability

(c) Advanced features
- Creating a table with multiple columns and rows which can be read via a screen reader
- Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar
- A contact form which leverages HTML forms



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
The only warnings I did not end up fixing were potential problems. Many of the issues listed were fine and had to be manually checked (which I did to the best of my ability)
against their guidelines (Ex. Is the alt text correct vs the image, do you have flashing lights etc.). Many of these warnings did not seem like they could be completely fixed
as they seem to be broad enough that it is not possible to detect correctness without human assistance. From what I could tell of my website against their guidelines, there 
did not seem to be any issues.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
Around 20-30 hours


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
Resources:
https://skylarshi.com/ (Portfolio of a second cousin I met recently)
https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/web-developer-portfolio (Looked through this initially to get ideas)
https://web3forms.com/#start
https://coolors.co/
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/ The entire docs, linking every single page would be excessive
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/scrollspy/#how-it-works
https://icons.getbootstrap.com/


Queries passed into LLMs:
"I stored a list of projects in a json file. I wish to load that file into a javascript file how do I do so"
"How do I ensure that imgs are consistent sizes despite the source images being different. I wish for the imgs to keep img-fluid properties of width: 100% and height: auto I am using bootstrap, consider crapping images that are too large"

VSCode's autocomplete was used for common syntax like closing tags and autofilling repetitive patterns like <li>

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
No individuals consulted.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
It should run without issue. Tested locally using a VSCode extension "Live Server" that made it easier to open the index.html but this is shouldn't be required to run.
